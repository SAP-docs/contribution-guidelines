# Code of Conduct

At the heart of great collaboration is a common sense of mutual respect and understanding, and the willingness to see the best, not the worst, in each other.

In the context of our collaborative aims for SAP documentation, we subscribe to the [Contributor Covenant][contributor-covenant], a code of conduct for open source communities. Refer to the latest version of that covenant and the standards and guidelines that it contains.

In addition to the Contributor Covenant, and as a useful quick reference here, we have a few points that we want you to read and follow carefully.

## Participation Etiquette

Our SAP Community has guidelines in the [Rules of Engagement][rules-of-engagement] document, and in particular, the items in that document's section on participation are worth highlighting here:

- Respect fellow members as human beings.
- Be supportive of each other.
- Be polite and friendly.
- Be tolerant and considerate.
- Act professionally, ethically and with integrity.
- Do not behave in an abusive, demeaning, discriminatory, defamatory, or harassing manner.
- Do not engage in personal attacks.

This is not an exhaustive list. The spirit of what's written here is equally as important as the individual and specific rules expressed.
