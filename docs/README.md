# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the general guidelines for contributing to SAP documentation. These guidelines explain how you can contribute to our documentation, what the overall process is, and what you can expect.

These are general contribution guidelines. There may be additional guidelines that are specific to particular documentation sets - you'll find those specifics in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in the corresponding repositories for those documentation sets on GitHub.
