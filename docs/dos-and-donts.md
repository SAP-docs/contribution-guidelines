# Dos and don'ts

It's better all round when collaborating if there are guidelines for what to do and what not to do. Here's a brief list of things we encourage, and things we discourage.

## Do

Following these guidelines will make collaboration flow more smoothly and productively.

- Try to provide as much contextual information in your issue or pull request as you can, to make it as clear as possible for your counterpart to understand what the feedback or change is, and why you think it's important.

- Before your first contribution, ensure you've completed the Contributors License Agreement (CLA) process, described in the [corresponding section](cla.md).

- Be respectful of your collaborators and regardless of where they are, treat them as you would treat any work colleague or team mate. After all, we're all only human at the end of the day. See the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) for more information.

- Remember to maintain your special `sap-community-profile` repository in your GitHub account, to make it possible for your valuable contributions to be recognized in the [SAP Community][sap-community]. See [Contribution recognition](recognition.md) for more details.

- When contributing content, be sure to check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository that relates to the documentation set that contains the documentation page upon which you're focusing. While there are general contribution guidelines (you're reading those guidelines right now) there may be repository-specific contribution guidelines too.

- Be patient with the contribution process. We want this to be a success and the start of a fruitful and open collaboration on SAP documentation generally, and for that, we need to travel these early paths together carefully. See [What to expect](what-to-expect.md) for more information.

## Don't

It's just as important to know what not to do, so here are some suggestions that should help.

- Avoid bundling multiple logical changes to different areas of documentation in a single contribution. Of course, if you're changing a typo or use of a word or phrase that needs addressing in multiple places, then you should treat that as a single logical change, but different changes for different reasons should be in different issues or pull requests, even if it's for the same SAP documentation page.

- Don't use feedback, in the form of issues, to ask questions on the documentation, or to report problems with the product, service or tool being described. There are other more appropriate channels for this (such as the  the [SAP Community Q&A][sap-community-q&a] and the [SAP Support Portal][sap-support-portal]).
