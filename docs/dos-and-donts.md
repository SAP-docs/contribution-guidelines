# Dos and Don'ts

Here's a brief list of things we encourage, and things we discourage.

## Do

Following these guidelines makes collaboration flow more smoothly and productively.

- Before your first contribution, ensure you've completed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) process, described in [The Contributor License Agreement process](cla.md).

- Try to provide as much contextual information in your issue or pull request as you can. This helps your counterpart on the SAP documentation team reviewing your request understand what the feedback or suggested change is, and why you think it's important.

- Be respectful of your collaborators and treat them as you would treat any work colleague or team mate. See the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) for more information.

- While most things are covered in the general contribution guidelines, check if there are additional guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file of the repository to which you're contributing.

- Be patient with the contribution process. We want this to be a fruitful and open collaboration on SAP documentation generally. See [What to Expect](what-to-expect.md) for more information, and if you have any feedback on the process in general, please let us know by creating an issue in the [Collaboration Guidelines repository](https://github.com/SAP-docs/contribution-guidelines).

- Remember that this collaborative process is focused on making SAP documentation the best it can be. It is not for raising issues about functionality, or problems in use or deployment of what's described in the documentation.

## Don't

It's just as important to know what not to do, so here are some suggestions that should help.

- Don't use feedback, in the form of issues, to ask general or specific questions about the documentation, or to report problems with the product, service, or tool being described. There are other more appropriate channels for this (such as the [SAP Community Q&A][sap-community-q&a] and the [SAP Support Portal][sap-support-portal]).

- Don't ask for new features, nor for enhancements or changes to existing features.

- Avoid bundling multiple changes to different areas of documentation in a single contribution. If you're changing a typo or use of a word or phrase that needs addressing in multiple places, then you should treat that as a single logical change, but different changes for different reasons should be in different issues or pull requests, even if these changes are all for the same SAP documentation page.

- Don't be despondent if your contribution is not accepted or actioned. While all contributions are assessed, it's likely that not all will be accepted.

- Don't be discouraged if someone disagrees with your viewpoint. While SAP documentation strives to be objective, there are many places in the documentation process that are subjective, and open to debate. When there is a disagreement, remember that it is an opportunity for all involved to learn.
