# Contribution Recognition in SAP Community

In [SAP Community][sap-community] there's a wide variety of [missions and badges][missions-badges], and we want to recognize valuable documentation contributions there too.

## Badges

In [SAP Community][sap-community] there are two badges relating to community contributions to documentation.

There's a "Documentation feedback contribution" badge, which will be awarded if you've contributed feedback in the form of an issue, which has subsequently led to an improvement in the documentation.

There's also a "Documentation content contribution" badge, which will be awarded if you've contributed content via the pull request method. In order to qualify, that pull request must have been merged and your content contribution included in the documentation.

## Linking Profiles

While recognition is made in [SAP Community][sap-community], the contribution activities themselves take place in [GitHub](https://github.com/SAP-docs). This means that in order to award a badge, a link is required that associates your GitHub profile with your SAP Community profile. This is so that qualifying contribution activities in GitHub can be recognized correctly for you in SAP Community.

It is your responsibility to create and maintain this link, as you are in control of your GitHub identity. The process is straightforward, and involves the creation of a public repository on GitHub named `sap-community-profile`, with the URL of your SAP Community profile in the description of that repository.

### Step by Step

This is what you need to do to create the link, illustrated by an example.

1. [Create a new repository][github-new] called `sap-community-profile`. The name *must* be as shown, that is, `sap-community-profile`. Any other name will mean that the link between your GitHub and SAP Community profiles won't be possible.

1. In the new repository's Description field, put the URL (and only the URL) of your SAP Community profile. This is made up of the base URL `https://people.sap.com/` followed by your SAP Community ID.

1. Choose to initialize the repository with a README file, by marking the corresponding checkbox. This is so you and others know what the (otherwise) empty repository is for.

1. Initiate the creation of the repository with the "Create repository" button.

Once your repository is created, it will look something like this:

Ensure that the two critical aspects (highlighted) are correct.

Once the repository exists and is in the form described here, recognition in SAP Community will be possible.
