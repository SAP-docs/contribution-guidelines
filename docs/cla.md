# The Contributor License Agreement process

A key ingredient in successful and fruitful collaboration is the mutual understanding and agreement between all those involved. To this end, in the context of contributions to SAP documentation, we offer a standard process based around the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which we invite you to follow before your first contribution. This ensures that everyone understands how contributions are made, accepted and used.

Before your first contribution to a documentation repository, you will be asked to review and accept a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This will be at the point you submit your first pull request (see the [Overall process](content-contribution/overall-process.md) description).

The DCO acceptance can be done within the pull request itself; look out for the CLA assistant that will guide you through the simple process.

SAP uses the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation.
