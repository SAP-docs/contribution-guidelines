# The Contributor License Agreement Process

A key ingredient in successful and fruitful collaboration is the mutual understanding and agreement between all involved.

To this end, in the context of contributions to SAP documentation, we require you to read and electronically sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). It is important that you understand how contributions are made, accepted, and used.

The CLA process happens automatically at the point you submit your first pull request. See [The Overall Process](content-contribution/overall-process.md) for more information.
