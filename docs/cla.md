# The Contributor License Agreement Process

A key ingredient in successful and fruitful collaboration is the mutual understanding and agreement between all involved.  It is important that you understand how contributions are made, accepted, and used.

To this end, in the context of contributions to SAP documentation, we require you to electronically sign the standard Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO) through an automated process. The DCO is an affirmation that the content being submitted originated from the person submitting the contribution, or that the submitter has permission to submit the content.  By making a contribution to the project, you are granting to the project a non-exclusive copyright license to use, reproduce and create further works using the contribution.  The DCO affirmation only needs to be done once, at the time of your first pull request.

The CLA process happens automatically at the point you submit your first pull request. See [The Overall Process](content-contribution/overall-process.md) for more information.
