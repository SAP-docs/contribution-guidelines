# What to Expect

Collaboration works better when expectations are understood all round. We want you to understand what to expect in relation to any SAP documentation collaboration.

## Initial Assessment

After you provide feedback in the form of an issue, or after you offer content contribution via a pull request, we make an initial assessment to check that it's relevant and to assign the appropriate documentation team members. In addition,  we will assign labels that describe and categorize the contribution.

The initial assessment is typically done within two business days starting from when you submit the issue or pull request, but can take longer, depending on available resources and number of submissions currently being assessed.

## Detailed Assessment

Once the initial assessment has taken place, we then review the contribution in detail.

This review may involve a conversation with you about your contribution to clarify details. An open, honest conversation is the key to successful collaboration. GitHub notifies you to take part in this conversation; please respond in a timely fashion.

In pull request conversations, you may be asked to modify the original submission, so that it fits better into the overall documentation context.

> For a given contribution, all collaboration, assessments, and conversations take place in the context (thread) of the issue or pull request that represents that contribution.

## Final Decision

After your contribution has been checked and discussed, we decide whether to add your contribution to the documentation.

If your contribution is accepted, it is then merged into the corresponding SAP documentation repository, and eventually finds its way onto the SAP Help Portal page from where you started the process.

If your contribution is not accepted, we will let you know why. To help with your next contribution, we suggest you have a look at [What Makes a Good Contribution](content-contribution/good-contribution.md).

Whether your contribution is accepted or not, we hope you found the collaboration process valuable.
