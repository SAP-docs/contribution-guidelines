# What to Expect

Collaboration works better when expectations are understood all round. We want you to understand what to expect in relation to any SAP documentation collaboration.

## Collaboration Possibilities

There are two different types of collaboration:
* feedback via issues.
* content contribution via pull requests.

Not all SAP documentation has these possibilities available. Collaboration is only possible where you see the relevant links. For some SAP documentation, collaboration is possible both via feedback and also via content contribution. For other SAP documentation, only one of those contribution types are available. And yet for other SAP documentation, neither is available.

> Note that all collaboration, assessments, and conversations take place, for a given contribution, in the context (thread) of the issue or pull request that represents that contribution.

More information: [Contributing to SAP Documentation](contributing.md)

## Initial Assessment

After you provide feedback in the form of an issue, or after you offer content contribution via a pull request, it is initially assessed.

The assessment is done within a 48-hour period starting from when you submit the issue or pull request, but can take longer, depending on available resources and number of submissions outstanding.

### Assignments

During the initial assessment, appropriate labels are assigned to your request that describe and categorize the contribution. It may also bring about the assignment to projects and milestones, and the assignment of one or more reviewers.

More information: [Managing labels][github-labels].

### Checks

Early on, the issue or pull request also undergoes checks. Those early checks are automated, and are to provide simple confirmations that basic contribution requirements have been met.

## Detailed Assessment

Once the initial assessment has taken place, a member of the appropriate SAP documentation team checks whether the contribution can be accepted.

This assessment covers various aspects; what those aspects are depends largely on your contribution and for which particular documentation set it is intended.

This assessment may involve further automated checks, and more importantly for you, involves a conversation about your contribution to clarify details. This is the key to success, and is at the heart of many successful pull request based collaboration flows across people and organizations. GitHub notifies you to take part in this conversation; please respond appropriately and in a timely fashion. We endeavor to do the same.

In pull request conversations, you may be asked to modify the original submission, so that it fits better, or complies with the relevant standards, style guides, and conventions.

More information: [How to Contribute Content](content-contribution/README.md).

## Final Decision

At an appropriate stage, your contribution is either deemed to be not appropriate for acceptance, or is ready to be accepted.

If it's the former, don't despair. You may wish to have a look at [What Makes a Good Contribution](content-contribution/good-contribution.md) and prepare yourself for a future successful contribution.

If it's the latter, congratulations and thank you for providing value to the SAP documentation overall. Your contribution is then merged into the relevant file in the corresponding SAP documentation repository, and this eventually finds its way into SAP and onto the SAP Help Portal page from where you started the process.

> In some rare circumstances, it may be that your content contribution was to a section of documentation that, during the submission process, was modified or even removed. In such cases your submission, while merged, would not appear on the SAP Help Portal page - not because any acceptance decision was reversed, but simply because the context of the contribution was now different.

Whether your contribution is accepted or not, we hope you found value from the collaboration process, and we thank you for that too.
