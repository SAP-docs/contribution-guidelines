# What to expect

Collaboration works better when expectations are understood all round. We want you to understand what to expect in relation to any SAP documentation collaboration.

## Collaboration possibilities

In [Contributing to SAP documentation](contributing/), two different types of collaboration are described - feedback (via issues) and content contribution (via pull requests).

Not all SAP documentation will immediately have these possibilities available. Collaboration is only possible where you see the relevant links. For some SAP documentation, collaboration will be possible both via feedback and also via content contribution. For other SAP documentation, only one of those contribution types will be available. And yet for other SAP documentation, neither will be available.

> Note that all collaboration, assessments and conversations will take place, for a given contribution, in the context (thread) of the issue or pull request that represents that contribution.

## Initial assessment

Where you provide feedback in the form of an issue, or where you offer content contribution via a pull request, that issue or pull request will be initially assessed.

This will usually be within a 48 hour period starting from when you submit the issue or pull request, but it may be longer, depending on available resources and number of submissions outstanding.

### Assignments

That initial assessment will usually bring about the assignment of appropriate [labels][github-labels] that describe and categorize the contribution. It may also bring about the assignment to projects and / or milestones, and the assignment of one or more reviewers.

### Checks

Early on, the issue or pull request may also undergo checks. Those early checks will usually be automated, and are to provide simple confirmations that basic contribution requirements have been met.

## Detailed assessment

Once the initial assessment has taken place, a member of the appropriate SAP documentation team will take a look, to assess whether the contribution can be accepted.

This assessment will cover various aspects; what those aspects are depends largely on your contribution and for which particular documentation set it is intended.

This assessment may involve further automated checks, and more importantly for you, may turn into a conversation about your contribution. This is the key to success, and is at the heart of many great pull request based collaboration flows across people and organizations. So please watch out for such a conversation (standard GitHub features will normally mean you're notified anyway) and please respond appropriately and in a timely fashion. We will endeavor to do the same.

In pull request conversations, it is not unusual for the submitter (you) to be asked to make modifications to the original submission, so that it fits better, or complies with the relevant standards, style guides and conventions. Please refer to the details in the [How to contribute content](content-contribution) for more information on this.

## Final decision

At an appropriate stage, your contribution will be deemed to be not appropriate for acceptance, or will be ready to be accepted.

If it's the former, don't despair. You may wish to have a look at [What makes a good contribution](content-contribution/good-contribution.md) and prepare yourself for a future successful contribution.

If it's the latter, congratulations and thank you for providing value to the SAP documentation overall. Your contribution will be merged into the relevant file in the corresponding SAP documentation repository, and this will eventually find its way into SAP and onto the SAP Help Portal page from where you started the process.

> In some rare circumstances, it may be that your content contribution was to a section of documentation that, during the submission process, was modified or even removed. In such cases your submission, while merged, would not appear on the SAP Help Portal page - not because any acceptance decision was reversed, but simply because the context of the contribution was now different.

Whether your contribution is accepted or not, we hope you found value from the collaboration involved, and we thank you for that too.
