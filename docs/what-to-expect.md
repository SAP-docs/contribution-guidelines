# What to expect

Collaboration works better when expectations are understood all round. We want you to understand what to expect in relation to any SAP documentation collaboration.

## Collaboration possibilities

In [Contributing to SAP documentation](contributing/), two different types of collaboration are described - feedback (via issues) and content contribution (via pull requests).

Not all SAP documentation will immediately have these possibilities available. Collaboration is only possible where you see the relevant links. For some SAP documentation, collaboration will be possible both via feedback and also via content contribution. For other SAP documentation, only one of those contribution types will be available. And yet for other SAP documentation, neither will be available.

> Note that all collaboration, assessments and conversations will take place, for a given contribution, in the context (thread) of the issue or pull request that represents that contribution.

## Initial assessment

Where you provide feedback in the form of an issue, or where you offer content contribution via a pull request, that issue or pull request will be initially assessed.

This will usually be within a 48 hour period starting from when you submit the issue or pull request, but it may be longer, depending on available resources and number of submissions outstanding.

### Assignments

That initial assessment will usually bring about the assignment of appropriate [labels][github-labels] that describe and categorize the contribution. It may also bring about the assignment to projects and / or milestones, and the assignment of one or more reviewers.

### Checks

Early on, the issue or pull request may also undergo checks. Those early checks will usually be automated, and are to provide simple confirmations that basic contribution requirements have been met.

###Â Detailed assessment

Once the initial assessment has taken place, a member of the appropriate SAP documentation team will take a look, to assess whether the contribution can be accepted.
