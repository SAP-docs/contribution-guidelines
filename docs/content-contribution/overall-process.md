# The overall process

This section describes the overall process for a pull request based content contribution. For a high level view of contributions, see [Contributing to SAP documentation](../contributing.md).

## Starting point

The overall process for content contribution starts with you.

Specifically, you're reading a page of SAP documentation on the SAP Help Portal. You come across something you're not quite sure is entirely accurate, or you've spotted a typo, or you think that there's a small addition or amendment that you can offer that would clarify or otherwise add value to what's already there.

You check to see if that particular page is open for collaboration. Whether it is or not depends if the documentation set to which the page belongs is enrolled in the SAP collaborative documentation initiative.
