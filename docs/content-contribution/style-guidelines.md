# Style Guidelines

This document outlines some style guidelines that we recommend when contributing content in Markdown.

## Recommended Style

This section describes approaches to Markdown style that are not mandatory but which we prefer and would recommend you adopt too, when offering a content contribution.

### Links

We prefer the "inline" approach for [links in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links).

This is the "inline" approach, where the URL follows the link text directly:

```markdown
See [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com) for more information.
```

In contrast, there is also the "reference" approach looks which like this:

```markdown
See [SAP Community](sapcommunity) for more information.

[sapcommunity]: https://community.sap.com
```

The URL is specified in a separate link label, which can appear anywhere in the document. But we prefer the "inline" approach in all circumstances.


### Section Headings

If you want to modify or create a new section heading, we recommend [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).
