# SAP Terminology

There are many aspects that, when combined, turn good documentation into great documentation. One of those aspects is correct and consistent use of terminology.

When preparing a content contribution, via a pull request, ensure that the appropriate SAP Terminology is used; whether that's for content that you're proposing to change, or offering as an addition.

The [SAP Terminology Database][sap-term], also known as SAPterm, gives you access to thousands of terminology entries in use at SAP. Use this database when preparing your content contribution. You may also find the [SAP Glossary][sap-glossary] useful.
