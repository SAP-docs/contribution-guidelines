# How to Provide Feedback

Of the two types of contribution, providing feedback is the simpler option. The process is similar to most ticketing flows you've have encountered in the past.

## Creating a New Issue

We use issues on GitHub, and when you follow a link to provide feedback on a particular page of documentation, you're taken automatically to the start of the issue creation workflow. Certain aspects of the new issue will already be set. For example, the issue will be created in the repository that contains the source of the documentation set in question, and that repository belongs to the [SAP-docs](https://github.com/SAP-docs) organization on GitHub.


Ensure that when creating a new feedback issue, that you add your feedback to the issue without removing any of the technical information that is automatically added to the main feedback edit area (in other words, in the body of the issue). This technical information associates your feedback with the appropriate page in the documentation.

Finally, metadata, such as labels, may also have already been preassigned to the issue.

## Providing Your Feedback

Add your feedback to the body of the issue. Try to limit your feedback to the specific documentation page you came from. This is important because it allows for a more focused and fruitful collaborative process.

Remember that providing feedback is about describing a problem or making an observation with the intent to get us to change something. For example, you may have observed that a product name has been consistently written incorrectly, or you may feel as though the documentation is not sufficient to perform the task at hand.

Providing feedback is not itself about contributing actual content. If you want to contribute content, see [How to Contribute Content](content-contribution/README.md).

## Engaging in the Conversation

Feedback in this context is a conversation. Be prepared to engage, and respond appropriately and in a timely fashion. Bear in mind that feedback can be subjective, and while your feedback is taken seriously it may not ultimately result in a change.

While it's important to supply as much information as you can to convey and contextualize your feedback, you should also use the conversational aspect of an issue to add more information if you feel it's required. This helps your correspondents understand what you see as the issue.

## Lifetime of an Issue

An issue remains in consideration as long as it's in the **Open** status. When an issue is moved to the **Closed** status, this signifies that either a change has been implemented, no change was deemed necessary, or mutual interest in the issue expired. In all of these cases, the outcome will be made clear in the issue, when closed.
