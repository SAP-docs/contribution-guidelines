name: Merged pull request labeler

# What the execution context is:
# The merging (not just closing) of a pull request.

# What it does:
# Assigns the 'valuable contribution' label.

# Why we need it:
# To mark a valuable pull request contribution, and thus to cause the
# SAP Community profile URL requester to be triggered.

# What's important to know:
# In order to have this workflow trigger another, a PAT is required,
# rather than a regular token. The label to assign is defined at the
# start of the job, in the LABEL environment variable.
