name: Disallowed content checker

# What the execution context is:
# A pull request on the main branch. Only relevant for users who
# are not members of the admin team for this repository.

# What it does:
# Checks to see if there are any files included in the pull request
# that we cannot accept. Only files in the docs/ directory are open
# to contribution.

# Why we need it:
# So the repository remains stable and we can focus on documentation
# contributions.

# What's important to know:
# The filter used in the check_files_changed step is a negated one,
# i.e. notice the use of the '!'. Read the filter like this: "The
# disallowed files are any that DON'T match docs/**". The membership
# check is for the team defined in the env var in the step (currently
# this is the '<repo>-admin' team.

Only actual documentation content, which is managed in the [docs]($DOCS_LOC) directory, is open for contribution.\n\nThe disallowed files that you submitted are:\n\n$DISALLOWED_FILES.\n\nYou'll need to revert all of the files you changed in that list using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/reverting-a-commit) or $REVERT_COMMAND. Once you get those files reverted, we can continue with the review process." \
