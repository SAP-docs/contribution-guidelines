name: SAP Community profile URL requester

# What the execution context is:
# The assignment of a label to an issue or pull request indicating
# that the contribution was valuable.

# What it does:
# Adds a comment to the issue or pull request asking the author for
# their SAP Community profile URL ('community ID').

# Why we need it:
# So that we can properly recognize the contribution in SAP Community.

# What's important to know:
# The label is specified at the start of the 'community-id-requester'
# job as an environment variable LABEL, and also in the job-level condition.
# Also, it adds a comment only after the first time the label is added.
