Warn when list looseness is incorrect, such as being tight when it should
be loose, and vice versa.

According to the [`markdown-style-guide`](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/),
if one or more list items in a list spans more than one line, the list is
required to have blank lines between each item.
And otherwise, there should not be blank lines between items.

By default, all items must be “loose” (a blank line must be between them)
if one or more items are multiline (span more than one line).
Otherwise, the list must be tight (no blank line must be between items).

If you pass `{checkBlanks: true}`, all items must be “loose” if one or more
items contain blank lines.
Otherwise, the list must be tight.

## Install

[npm][]:

```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-list-item-spacing",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-list-item-spacing readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-list-item-spacing'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
