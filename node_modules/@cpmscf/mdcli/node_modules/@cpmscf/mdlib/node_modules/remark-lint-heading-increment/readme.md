## Install

[npm][]:

npm install remark-lint-heading-increment
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-heading-increment",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-heading-increment readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-heading-increment'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
