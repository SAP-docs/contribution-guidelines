Warn when shortcut reference links are used.

Shortcut references render as links when a definition is found, and as
plain text without definition.
Sometimes, you don’t intend to create a link from the reference, but this
rule still warns anyway.
In that case, you can escape the reference like so: `\[foo]`.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| Preset | Setting |
| - | - |
| [`remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-markdown-style-guide) | |
| [`remark-preset-lint-recommended`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint/tree/main/packages/remark-preset-lint-recommended) | |

## Example

##### `ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[foo][]

[foo]: http://foo.bar/baz
```

###### Out

No messages.

##### `not-ok.md`

###### In

```markdown
[foo]

[foo]: http://foo.bar/baz
```

###### Out

```text
1:1-1:6: Use the trailing `[]` on reference links
```

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-lint-no-shortcut-reference-link
```

## Use

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

```diff
 …
 "remarkConfig": {
   "plugins": [
     …
     "lint",
+    "lint-no-shortcut-reference-link",
     …
   ]
 }
 …
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```sh
remark -u lint -u lint-no-shortcut-reference-link readme.md
```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 var remark = require('remark')
 var report = require('vfile-reporter')

 remark()
   .use(require('remark-lint'))
+  .use(require('remark-lint-no-shortcut-reference-link'))
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**', function (err, file) {
     console.error(report(err || file))
   })
```
